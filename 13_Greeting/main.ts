//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, 
//but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. 
//The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let friend_Name :string[]=["Kinza","Fatime","hoorain","Alveena"];
   friend_Name.forEach(friend_Name => {
          console.log(`${friend_Name} , "Wishing you Good health love and happiness".`);
